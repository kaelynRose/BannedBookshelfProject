                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>At The Forbidden Bookshelf, we aim to provide information about books that have been banned from libraries for any reason. Knowledge is power, and banning books is the easiest way for those in power to prevent the rest of us from rising up against them. Be a rebel, read a book.</p>

                <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Books have been banned around the world for ages. There are accounts from as far back as 259 B.C. of books being banned or destroyed. (<a href="https://www.freedomtoread.ca/resources/bannings-and-burnings-in-history/"><cite>Bannings and Burnings in History</cite>, n.d.</a>) Even the Bible has been banned in the past, though now it is one of the most printed books in the world. During World War II, Nazi Germany burned thousands of books to prevent access to them. Many schools around the world and across the ages have been banning books they deemed to be inappropriate for children. Banning books in schools is not something of the past, from 2021 to 2022 over a thousand books were banned in schools across the United States. (<a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">Friedman, 2022</a>) These books range in topics, but over half of the books that were banned had LGBTQ+ themes or characters, protagonist or prominent characters of color, sexual content, and issues of race and racism. (<a href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">Friedman, 2022</a>) The fight against banning books has been a long one, and it is far from over.</p>
